The email validation function should accept a string as input and return a boolean indicating whether the email is valid, along with a clear error message if it's not. A valid email must contain a single "@" symbol separating the local part from the domain. The domain must include at least one dot (".") and a top-level domain (TLD) of at least two characters, such as ".com", ".org", ".net", etc. The function should specifically check for the presence of the "@" symbol and a properly formatted domain, providing distinct error messages for each validation failure (e.g., "Email must contain @" or "Invalid domain format").
