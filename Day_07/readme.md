## Short Note for SPECKit Plus

SPECKit Plus is not an AI tool — it is a framework that works with existing AI tools and provides a methodology and structure to systematically capture the “why” behind your code.
It is built on two architectures of Reusable Intelligence:

## 1. Vertical Intelligence

Delegates different tasks to different agents.

Makes work faster and higher quality.

## 2. Horizontal Intelligence

Captures reasoning and decisions across time.

Acts as institutional memory, preserving knowledge from project to project.

Prevents repeated mistakes.

Constitution Phase

Defines the foundational rules of the project.

Serves as the team’s rulebook for both humans and AI.

Builds a clear mission and sets boundaries before development begins.

## Specify Phase

Team writes clean and exact specifications for the system.

Includes features, behaviors, limitations, inputs, and outputs.

Ensures everyone knows exactly what to build, with no assumptions.

## Plan Phase

Specifications turn into a realistic development plan.

Includes timelines, resources, task breakdowns, strategies, and dependencies.

Ensures the workflow moves logically from start to finish.

## Task Phase

High-level plans become small, clear, executable tasks.

Each task defines what must be done and who will do it.

Improves coordination and reduces confusion.

## Implementation Phase

Actual development happens here.

Teams write code, build components, test features, and fix issues.

Executes everything prepared in earlier phases.
