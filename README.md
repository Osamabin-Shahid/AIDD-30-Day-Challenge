# What does AI-Driven Development mean to you?
AI-Driven Development, as the name suggests, means that AI takes over the majority of the development work, so we no longer need to write code yourself. Our responsibility is to identify market gaps, shape ideas, and create clear plans, then assign those tasks to AI. In this model, Our role shifts from manual coding to strategic direction, while the AI handles the actual software creation. Simply put, we focus on vision and guidance, and AI turns our ideas into reality.

# How do you see the future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development?
In the future, I see a strong partnership between humans and AI. Before this, a human had to find a problem, think about the solution, make plans, and then spend a lot of time writing code to build a website or software. This process was slow and required a lot of effort.
But with Human–AI collaboration, things become much easier. The human will mainly focus on finding the problem, planning the solution, and creating strategies, while the AI will handle the development work. AI will turn the human’s direction and ideas into real software.
This gives many benefits: you don’t have to write long code, you don’t need to worry about syntax or debugging, and you don’t need a big team anymore. Even one person can manage a full project with the help of AI.
